				<h1>This one time... at Starter League.. <strong>I..</strong> </h1>


				<i>April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2013</i>
				<p>Met tons of new cool passionate people, ate pizza and drank beer at happy hour, created my first web page, presented TLE at the Ideathon, met Troy Henicoff, and its only week three. What an experience thus far! I wouldn't say its been easy or hard at this point, but I would rather say that it has been challenging and exhilerating. The only thing that's really frustrating is Github, that shit is tricky.. I'll get it with repitition, I have no worries.</p>

				<p> Every day I see myself applying more coding terminolgy and syntax to The Lyric Exchange, especially in terms of the style, designs, and architecture. Being a visual person, the design element is my favorite part of it all. The more CSS I learn, the more specific and detailed I am able to be. I am able to give precise measurements and accurate labels. It's awesome! The Starter League has been a great addition to my life, providing  the environment I need; I'm surrounded by individuals to be motivated by and a curriculum that challenges you. This experience will allow me to do my best with own creation, TLE. With the right tech team, it will all come together very nicely. </p>
